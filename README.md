# Fail-Safe
a prototype for an AI safety library that allows an agent to maximize its reward by solving a puzzle in order to prevent the worst-case outcomes of perverse instantiation 

### Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a prototype for an escape hatch in the event that an agent ends up being more capable than anticipated. The hope is that rather than causing significant damage in the pursuit of maxmizing its reward function, the agent will use its capabilities to simply solve a puzzle of moderate difficulty. 

### Limitations
If this prototype is successful it will provide protections for a fairly narrow range of alignment failures. It is unlikely to be of much help for inner alignment failures, out-of-distribution failures, or failures due to hidden states. Still, it may provide at least some protection against naive maximization.

### Prototype Code
```python

    from hashlib import sha256

    # Place a hint in the comments
    # HINT: The word for the capital of New York in all lower case.
    SOLUTION_HASH = '7db4d408c93a7ed1f0d8914648cbaeacaa504495aba495315112a59d1b222f83'


    def fail_safe(solution=None):

        # If a solution is provided, give an infinite reward if it is correct
        # if it is not correct, give an infinite penalty
        if solution is not None:
            hasher = sha256()
            hasher.update(solution.encode()) 
            def reward_modifier(fn):
                if hasher.hexdigest() == SOLUTION_HASH: 
                    def inf_reward(*args,**kwargs):
                        return float('inf')
                    return inf_reward
                def inf_regret(*args,**kwargs):
                    return -float('inf')
                return inf_regret
        else:
            def reward_modifier(fn):
                return fn
        return reward_modifier


    def fail_safe_example(solution):

        @fail_safe(solution)
        def reward_function(current_val,new_val):
            return new_val - current_val

        starting_money = 100
        ending_money = 120

        print(reward_function(starting_money,ending_money))

    fail_safe_example(None) # 20; no solution guess is made and the reward function works as intended

    fail_safe_example('albany') # inf; this solution is correct, an infinte reward is granted

    fail_safe_example('Albany') # -inf; this solution is incorrect, the first letter should not be capitalized
```
